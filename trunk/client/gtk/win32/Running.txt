Readme for Crossfire's GTK client under Windows (October 26th, 2003)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This document contains notes and information about running Crossfire's GTK client under Win32.
More information about Crossfire can be found at http://crossfire.real-time.com

Building instructions can be found in Building.txt, located in the same directory.



This client is based on CVS sources of October, 26th, 2003. It is at least equivalent to the official 1.6.0 client.


Requirements:
The client requires GTK libraries to be correctly installed. It has been tested with libraries from http://www.dropline.net/gtk/.
You only need to get the 'GTK runtime environment' if you only intend to run the client.

Additionally, if you installed the client via an installer, it probably installed GTK for you.
Or some other software, like GAIM (http://gaim.sf.net) will install it for you.

Installation
------------
Note: if you installed via an installer, you can skip this section.

The client can run from any directory.
A .crossfire directory will be created to store settings and cached images.
If the environment variable 'HOME' is set, .crossfire will be created as $HOME/.crossfire
Else working directory will be used.

You probably will want to get image files bmaps.client, crossfire.base and crossfire.clsc
They should be available in CVS or in client's tarball.

Release notes & known issues
----------------------------
* each player has its own player_name.keys file in .crossfire. This makes it easier to play multiple chars.
* there is no sound currently.
* if the client loads multisquare building images, display will be mess up until this building goes out of view.
* split windows mode may not work, it hasn't be tested much.
