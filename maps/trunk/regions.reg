Grass, mountains, trees, rivers, and not a soul to be seen for miles around, the wilderness is not the most civilized of places, and stories that have reached the towns tell of fearsome creatures and labyrinthine dungeons far under the surface. Of course, these rumours have never been verified, though the few who have tried have taken a long time in doing so....

msg
The Imperial Highway was built long ago, so much so that its origins are now long since passed out of recorded history and into the stuff of legends. In the years since its construction it has gained the name "The yellow Brick Road" on account of the distinctive colour of its paving. Whilst in former times the Imperial highway was safe to all who would pass along it, in recent times it has started to decay, as the toll of centuries comes to bear on this once-splendid testament to past powers.

msg
Nestled snugly in a sheltered bay at the west of the Imperial Highway, Scorn is a safe and welcoming place for those who pass by. Its position on the Imperial highway allows it to maintain its importance as a stopping off point between the other major cities along the route and an attractive location for trade and commerce. This combined with the sheltered harbour and extensive shipping lines, ensures that Scorn remains a key crossroads bustling with activity, long after its former military dominance has diminished.

You find yourself gasping in wonder at the extensive caverns underneath the city, here there remains the ruins of old Scorn. A reminder of the great power the city once possessed, and a sign of how far it has fallen. As you look around however you notice that whilst the previous inhabitants of these ruins are no longer present, some new ones seem to have taken their place, and these denizens don't appear to be very welcoming.

msg
Founded by Lord Butakis, this land is a unique region of lakes, rivers and the sea. Changes, both natural and unnatural, had drastically transformed the landscape of this area.  Rivers had been diverted, lakes were drained, and the sea had reseeded - only to have all this undone or remade through a catastrophic flood a decade later.
As a result of this devastation, one needs to recognize the hardship and sorrow that has been a burden on this land. Many lives have been lost, several graves - marked and unmarked fill area.  Rumors that the fog, which covers the land, is a testament of the grief and anguish experienced by the first settlers has drawn those brave enough to face such superstition.  Another interest of lore is the wandering spirit from the nearby forest; a spirit in which seems to be holding grudge from ages ago. Others travel to Lake Country because of its reputation - the rich shops operated by retired adventurers, the Training Tower and the safety within the Fortress of Lord Butakis.

msg
Port Joseph is located on the largest (which isn't saying much) of a chain of islands west of the Kingdom of Scorn.  While the island doesn't boast very much, most everything there is very practical.  How the times have changed. The early days of Port Joseph was a haven for the most ruthless band of pirates that the high seas has ever seen. The infamous reputation of Port Joseph died with the passing of renowned pirate admiral, Moogley Bill. While his legend lives on, his treasure horde is still missing. Thanks to increased presence and protection from The King's Navy, many trade routes now pass through or near the area, so that makes the Port a frequent stop and transfer point for merchants.  However, the pirate roots are still relevant today.

Stoneville is a small ship port located on the western side of Dragon Island. The island primarily serves as a vacation residence for wealthy merchants and adventurers.  For those who are not quite ready for retirement or seeking fame - guilds and shops keep those travelers well stocked and tested.  Of course, the islands riches also seem to attract those with nefarious purposes who have taken hold of the various caves in the nearby mountains.  And in some cases, more closer to home then what most inhabitants would like.

msg
Some believe natural elements have caused the once proud Kingdom of Narcopin to fall in to ruins. Others think a conquering army left behind this decrepit area in route to greater conquest. Some would say it was a famine or monster invasion. No one would argue that frequent dust storms and marauding monsters has left behind just a few of the once many structures - any of which could collapse into rubble at any moment. Many are convinced ancient and lost treasure awaits those brave enough to explore this region. A few have attempted to explore this area; from archaeologists and adventurers to tomb raiders. If there is anything left of value, it has either been plundered or no one has lived long enough to find it - or leave with it. One thing is for certain, there is something very unnatural and unfinished with the fate of this whole area.

Also known as Terra Glaci in Old Navarian, this frozen wasteland is located on the far edge of the known world. The "Land of Frost" has been partially settled by those brave (or foolish) enough to fend off the Polar Bears, Ice elementals, Frost Dragons and similar monstrosities.  Those in residence make a living (well, mere existence) out of whaling, which is why many of the nearby islands make up the Whaling Outpost. No one knows for sure who or how many reside around here, as the appetite of any wondering beast leaves countless dwellings empty and numerous ships at the bottom of the sea.

msg
What should be a pristine valley nestled between two mountain ridges is rife in discord.  Three Sisters, on their quest to immortality, found a way to craft an item that rivaled creations from the ancient gods.  For such an infractions - the ancient gods punished The Sisters, leaving them scarred and disfigured with wounds that would have killed any one else. The curse of immortality was then realized, but incomplete. Each of The Three Sisters lost their greatest Gift, which now reside deep in the vaults of the nearby factions.  For centuries now, conflict erupts daily as raids between each sect fights to a inevitable stalemate with one another over control of each Sister's Gift.  Trapped in their tower, The Three Sisters wait for destiny to grant them one last favor by making them whole once again.  Now that the ancient gods are no more - they could once again practice their craft.

Situated about half way between The Kingdom of Navar and The Sultanate of Darcap, Marksel is a mining town whose old motto seemed to be, "Enough to Live With." A small group of sages, with their research, drives the demand for the mines rich metal.  As long as the work pays wages enough to keep the ale flowing from the nearby tavern, miners will be back at their post the following day.  Something has changed though, just as the hamlet was about to prosper, the trade roads leading to it fell under siege from bandits.  The merchant trade contracts have defaulted; the roads are too risky and unsafe. The forces of Lord Marksel have seen the tide of battle tip away from their favor.  Their hope dims with each passing day.

The Fortress of Lord Butakis stands as a testament to the determination of Butakis to settle and secure the area called Lake Country. This bastion of security provides a hard line of defense against the demons, dragons, rogue wizard faction and agents of chaos that plague this land. While the stronghold stands in defiance of disorder, there seems to be dark forces at work from the inside; slowly whittling away the foundation of what the Fortress represents.  As a result of this, security of the Fortress has greatly increased in the past years.  A few have grown concerned over the very crowded prison filled with accused spies, thieves, and worse.
