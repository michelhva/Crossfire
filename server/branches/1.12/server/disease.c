 * For DISEASES:
 * Stat            Property        Definition
 *
 * attacktype      Attack effects  Attacktype of the disease. usu. AT_GODPOWER.
 * other_arch      Creation        object created and dropped when symptom moved.
 * title           Message         When the "disease" "infects" something, it will
 *                                 print "title victim!!!" to the player who owns
 *                                 the "disease".
 * wc+             Infectiousness  How well the plague spreads person-to-person
 * magic+          Range           range of infection
 * Stats*          Disability      What stats are reduced by the disease (str con...)
 * maxhp+          Persistence     How long the disease can last OUTSIDE the host.
 *  * value           TimeLeft        Counter for persistence
 * dam^            Damage          How much damage it does (%?).
 * maxgrace+       Duration        How long before the disease is naturally cured.
 * food            DurCount        Counter for Duration
 *
 * speed           Speed           How often the disease moves.
 * last_sp^        Lethargy        Percentage of max speed--10 = 10% speed.
 *
 * maxsp^          Mana deplete    Saps mana.
 * ac^             Progressiveness How the diseases increases in severity.
 * last_eat*^      Deplete food    saps food if negative
 * last_heal       GrantImmunity   If nonzero, disease does NOT grant immunity
 *                                 when it runs out
 *
 * exp             experience      experience awarded when plague cured
 * hp*^            ReduceRegen     reduces regeneration of disease-bearer

 *
 * name            Name            Name of the plague

 * race            those affected  species/race the plague strikes (* = everything)
 * level           Plague Level    General description of the plague's deadliness
 * armour          Attenuation     reduction in wc per generation of disease.
 *                                 This builds in a self-limiting factor.
 *
 *
 * Explanations:
 * * means this # should be negative to cause adverse effect.
 * + means that this effect is modulated in spells by ldur
 * ^ means that this effect is modulated in spells by ldam
 *
 * attacktype is the attacktype used by the disease to smite "dam" damage with.
 *
 * wc/127 is the chance of someone in range catching it.
 *
 * magic is the range at which infection may occur.  If negative, the range is
 * NOT level dependent.
 *
 * Stats are stat modifications.  These should typically be negative.
 *
 * maxhp is how long the disease will persist if the host dies and "drops" it,
 *       in "disease moves", i.e., moves of the disease.  If negative, permanent.
 *
 * value is the counter for maxhp, it starts at maxhp and drops...
 *
 * dam     if positive, it is straight damage.  if negative, a %-age.
 *
 * maxgrace  how long in "disease moves" the disease lasts in the host, if negative,
 *           permanent until cured.
 *
 * food    if negative, disease is permanent.  otherwise, decreases at <speed>,
 *         disease goes away at food=0, set to "maxgrace" on infection.
 *
 * speed is the speed of the disease, how fast "disease moves" occur.
 *
 * last_sp is the lethargy imposed on the player by the disease.  A lethargy
 *        of "1" reduces the players speed to 1% of its normal value.
 *
 * maxsp how much mana is sapped per "disease move".  if negative, a %-age is
 *      taken.
 *
 * ac  every "disease move" the severity of the symptoms are increased by
 *     ac/100.  (severity = 1 + (accumlated_progression)/100)
 *
 * last_eat  increases food usage if negative.
 *
 *
 *
 * For SYMPTOMS:
 *
 * Stats            modify stats
 * hp               modify regen
 * value            progression counter (multiplier = value/100)
 * food             modify food use (from last_eat in DISEASE)
 * maxsp            suck mana ( as noted for DISEASE)
 * last_sp          Lethargy
 * msg              What to say
 * speed            speed of movement, from DISEASE
