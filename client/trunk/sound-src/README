How Does it Work?
-----------------
The sound server gets information about sounds to be played on standard input.
The information is a line:
<sound number> <sound type> <relative x> <relative y>
All those numbers are hex.
The file ~/.crossfire/sounds contains description of sound numbers and types.
For example:
3 0 5 0
Means that normal sound SOUND_FUMBLE spell should be played as it's source was
5 units to the right of player.

Sounds are mixed in special buffers, which are in fact one buffer, which should
be big enough for the biggest sound to be played.

The buffers, if contain anything, are sent one by one to the sound device.
Each buffer is cleaned after playing.

Sounds data is multiplied by some ratio (<1) evaluated from it's position and
volume and added to the buffers, starting from the next after the one being
played.

So bigger buffer means bigger delay, before the sound is actually played, but
the smaller buffer is, the bigger is possibility, we won't succeed filling the
next buffer, before last is played.
