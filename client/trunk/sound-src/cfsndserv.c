/**
 * Preliminary handler for Crossfire server sound2 and music commands that are
 * received from the client via stdin.
 *
 * The sound player differentiates sound2 and music commands by looking at the
 * first parameter that comes in.  Music commands consist of a single, quoted
 * string that identifies the music to play, while a sound effect command has
 * various numeric parameters followed by strings that identify what to play.
 *
 * Sound2 data consists of whitespace delimited values:  x, y, dir, vol, type,
 * sound, and source.  Type, sound, and source define what to play, while the
 * other parameters may be used to figure out how to play it.  x and y are
 * offsets from the player to identify where the sound originated. dir can be
 * set to indicate a direction that the source is travelling in. vol is an
 * attenuation factor (0-100) that may be applied to the sound volume to make
 * it possible, for example, to give map-designers the ability to suggest
 * relative loudness of sounds in the environment.
 *
 * FIXME: This is a work-in-progress.  The sound2 was put into the server
 * without a plan to fix the clients.  cfsndserv is basically made obsolete by
 * sound2.  The basic fix resurrects some sound support but does not fully
 * implement the features sound2 is supposed to provide.
 *
 * @param data A text buffer that (hopefully) has a sound or music command.
 * @param len  The length of the text data in the command buffer.
 * @return     0 if the buffer contains a well-formed command, otherwise -1.
