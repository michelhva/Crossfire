/**
 * @file
 * Client interface main routine.  Sets up a few global variables, connects to
 * the server, tells it what kind of pictures it wants, adds the client and
 * enters the main dispatch loop.
 *
 * The main event loop (event_loop()) checks the TCP socket for input and then
 * polls for x events.  This should be fixed since you can just block on both
 * filedescriptors.
 *
 * The DoClient function receives a message (an ArgList), unpacks it, and in a
 * slow for loop dispatches the command to the right function through the
 * commands table.   ArgLists are essentially like RPC things, only they don't
 * require going through RPCgen, and it's easy to get variable length lists.
 * They are just lists of longs, strings, characters, and byte arrays that can
 * be converted to a machine independent format
