 *
 * Instead of having a whole mess of variables of different names, instead use
 * a common 16 bit signed array, and index into these - this makes processing
 * in the GUI aspect of the GTK client much easier.
 *
 * There are also 2 elements - want_options, and use_options.  The former is
 * what the player wants to use, the latter is what is currently in use.
 * There are many options that can not be switched between during actual play,
 * but we want to record what the player has changed them to so that when we
 * save them out, we save what the player wants, and not what is currently
 * being used.
 *
 * Note that all the GUI interfaces may not use all these values, but making
 * them available here makes it easy for the GUI to present a nice interface.
 *
 * 0 is intentially skipped so the index into this doesn't get a default if a
 * table has a blank value
 *
 * CONFIG_NUMS is the number of configuration options; don't forget to add to
 * some of:
 *
 *   common/init.c config_names,
 *                 init_client_vars,
 *   x11/x11.c load_defaults
 *             save_defaults
 *   gtk/config.c load_defaults
 *                save_defaults
