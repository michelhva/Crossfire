# def-keys -- default client keybindings
#
# This file contains a set of default client keybindings. It is converted into
# a C header file at build time and parsed by the client when a key file isn't
# found in the user's home folder or a default system location.
#
# <keysym> <keynro> <flags> <string>
#
# <keynro> will typically be the keycode for that key.  While
# keysyms are defined to work across different servers, keycodes are
# server/machine specific. Keycodes are only needed because some keyboards
# (sun's type 5 for one) have keys with no corresponding keysym.
# When loading, all keysyms are converted to keycodes for matching.
#
# Flags:
#   N - Normal mode
#   F - Fire mode
#   R - Run mode
#   A - All modes
#   E - Leave in line edit mode
