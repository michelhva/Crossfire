Readme for Crossfire's GTK client under Windows (August, 21st, 2005)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This document contains notes and information about running Crossfire's GTK client under Win32.
More information about Crossfire can be found at http://crossfire.real-time.com

Building instructions can be found in Building.txt, located in the same directory.
Changes from previous versions are listed in 'Changes' or 'Full change log' files from
start menu.


This is release 1.8.0 of the client.


Requirements
------------
The client requires GTK libraries to run. It has been tested with libraries from http://www.dropline.net/gtk/
and the ones provided by Pidgin.

You only need to get the 'GTK runtime environment' if don't plan on compiling the client.
Client has been compiled with version 2.4.6. Use older versions at your own risk. Newer versions should be ok.

Some other software, like Pidgin (http://pidgin.sf.net) will install GTK for you.


GTK Warning
-----------
People have reported many issues with GTK. If you experience any trouble, before asking for
help, check http://www.metalforge.net/cfmb/, the 'bugs' and/or 'Spoilers and help request'
forums.


Installation
------------
Note: if you installed via an installer, you can skip this section.

The client can run from any directory.
A .crossfire directory will be created to store settings and cached images.
If the environment variable 'HOME' is set, .crossfire will be created as $HOME/.crossfire
Else your application's directory will be used.


Release notes & known issues
----------------------------
* each player has its own <player_name>.keys file in .crossfire. This makes it easier to play multiple chars.
* there is no sound currently.
* if the client loads multisquare building images, display may be mess up until this building goes out of view.
* split windows mode may not work, it hasn't be tested much.
