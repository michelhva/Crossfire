# Start of Stat Bar styles
############################################################################

# The stat bars are the bars at the bottom left of the window - hp,
# spell points, grace, food & exp.
# The low values are used when the stat is less than 25% of its max.
# The super value is used when the stat is above is max.
# the normal value is used in the 25%->100% range.
#
# There is no requirement that these be different colors - if you
# want the food value to be brown no matter what, just create
# a style for food_bar, and bind that to the normal/low/super values.
# this is what is done for exp, since being below 25% exp isn't really
# bad.
#
# If you have configured the client to use gradual shading of the
# stat bar colors, the gradual values are used instead.  The low
# as the 0 point, the normal is 100%, and super is 200%.  The client
# will then mix the color based on the actual value of the stat.  I thought
# it better to have different values, as what may look good normally may
# not blend well (in particular, the standard values are not 100%
# saturated since those would seem too bright.
#
# the reason base[SELECTED] is used for values is that is what
# is used if these were being bound directly to the widget.
#
# if one of the styles is missing a color, the client will use
# standard system wide theme defaults to draw in that state.
# For the gradual color, if it is missing a color, it just will
# not color it - probably not what you want.
#
# Note: If you are not seeing colorful stat bars as you expect,
# the problem may be with the system wide theme you have chosen.
# some themes modify the draw logic for the progressbar and instead
# draw pixmaps (if you see striped bars, you are using such a theme).
# These themes do no pay any attention to the colors we try to set -
# IMO, this is a bug in the theme engine, as there isn't way
# to turn that behaviour off.  The only way around this would be
# for the client to have its own widget to draw the bars, but then
# this causes problems for those people that like that theme.

# it can not set up the other styles.

# The extended info has the idea of different fonts:
#
# Normal: Standard font to use for drawing
# Arcane: Perhaps better called 'old style' fonts - still clearly readable,
#   but should have an 'old' look.
# Strange: A runic font that doesn't necessarily need to be readable - could
#   just be symbols.
# Fixed: Fixed width font used for listings of preformatted text.
# Hand: A font that should look like handwritten text.
#
# Note that except for the fixed font, the font you use is not likely
# to have a critical effect - if you used the same font for everything,
# it is unlikely to affect the play of the game.
# Also, while these are defined as font names, you can also define
# colors.  However, other
# styles may take precedence - eg, if you specify a color in the
# style definition, and the message itself has color tags, those
# may be used instead.
#
# You can use the gtk character map utility to view the fonts and get
# font names.
#
# Note that the fonts specified here may not be ideal candidates, but

# these msg_.. values determine how to draw output of the
# different message types - see the newclient.h and msgtypes.h file for all
# the types/subytpes.  With this, you can set different output styles
# for all of the different message types.
#
# A few notes:
#
# 1) it is the widget_class line that binds the the style to the name that
# the client uses to look it up.
# Thus, you can do something like:
#
# style "red_text" ....
# widget_class "msg_victim_was_pushed" style "red_text"
# widget_class "msg_communication_say" style "red_text"
# 
# In this way, you don't need to have a style for every msg type - a more
# likely scenario is a modest number of styles, but then binding these
# to the different widget names as how you want that widget to be
# drawn.  The <color>_text entries used above can be re-used
# for the msg types here.
#
# 2) Beyond normal style inheritence rules, the client itself is coded
# to do some - just in that way, you don't need to list every msg
# type here.  For example:
#
# widget_class "msg_book" style "green_text"
#
# will result in every message of the BOOK class to be drawn in green
# text.  If you then add the line:
#
# widget_class "msg_book_clasp_1" style "red_text"
#
# messages of type BOOK, subtype CLASP_1 will be drawn in red, with all
# the other BOOK message types being drawn in green.
#
# Note that this works on a type/subtype level, not a # string level.  Thus,
# you can not do:
#
# widget_class "msg_book_clasp" style "red_text"
#
# and have it work, as the "msg_book_clasp" by itself isn't a valid name.
# Basically, you can bind it to the overall type (which covers all the
# subtypes), or to specific type/subtypes. Tthe common/msgtypes.h file
# contains  all the valid names (without the msg_ prefix) that are valid.
#
# 3) Even with the new message types, the server still sends what color
# it thinks they should be drawn (this is basically for older clients
# predating extended text support).  If you do not specify _ANY_ styles for the
# message types here, the client will use that color tag for what color
# to draw the text with, as set with the info_<color> section above.
# However, if even a single msg_ style is set, then the client will not
# use those values - the presumption being that if a msg_ style
# is set, the user knows what they are doing, and any that are not
# set they want in default color/style.
#
# This is because there really isn't any way
# for the client to know if it is intentional on the part of the user
# that they want to use the default styles for the widgets or if it 
# should be using that color information - this is especially true
# given the inheritence described in point #2 above.
#


# The entries below try to match what color the server says
# to use for these - basically, to keep compatibility without
# having to use the passed in color value - in that way,
# additions can be made and the expected appearance of messages
# will remain.
# Given this is compatible type messages, we re-use
# the color_text styles above.  Note that in some cases,
# the same type of message used different colors depending
# on where in the code it was called.  I've tried to use here
# whatever was used the most for a particular message, but
# I also took into account the message and other related messages
# so the color for good vs bad effects are different, etc.  To
# some extent, the idea that red messages are bad is put in place
# here, with blue being good.
#
# Note - these should really be re-done, as the current color
# scheme often makes no sense (same style for both a level
# gain and loss?) But this base file is more as a sample
# and also act like things have in the past.
#
# Some colors, like lightgreen, gold & tan are not used by
# any message types right now.  And some others are used
# in only a few places, like greytext, browntext
#
# these are in type/subtype order, to match msgtypes.h
