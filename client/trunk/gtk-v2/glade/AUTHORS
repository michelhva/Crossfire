The original gtk-v2.glade file by Mark Wedel was the basis for the following
layout files.  In fact, all layouts for the GTK-v2 client must contain the
basic widget set found in that work.

- gtk-v2.glade
- dialogs.glade

The conversion of the client to support libglade came shortly after Kevin
Bulgrien began developing experimental alternative layouts by copying and
modifying the original gtk-v2.glade layout. Some of those initial layouts
are are found in the following files:

- caelestis.glade       A tri-column layout with a tall inventory/floor panels
                        to the right. At the top middle, a two tab notebook
                        for character and skill/experience data sits above map
                        views beneath. To the top left is a three tab notebook
                        for core stats, critical messages, and protections. At
                        the lower left is the messages pane with entry box.

- chthonic.glade        A tri-column layout with a tall inventory/floor panels
                        to the right. At the top middle, a two tab notebook
                        holds the map views above a notebook for character and
                        skill/experience data.  To the top left is the critical
                        message box with the standard message box and command
                        input below.  The bottom left corner two tab notebook
                        houses protections and core statistics.

- gtk-v1.glade          An approximation of the original GTK client layout.

- meflin.glade          A player-suggested modification of an experimental
                        layout, and as such, is probably subject to change.
                        Presently a map view notebook is at top right with
                        messages and inventory/ground views sharing a tabbed
                        notebook to the left.  At the bottom rest the stat
                        bars and a three tab notebook for character data.

- oroboros.glade        A layout designed for 1024x768 desktops.  On the left
                        are a tabbed message window, inventory, and floor view.
                        To the right, at the top is a four tab notebook that
                        contains all of the character statistics, and below it
                        is the map view.  At 1024x768, the map view is 20x13.
                        Since oroboros makes heavy use of tabbed notebooks, it
                        is also appropriate for those that prefer to see lessi
                        information simultaneously on screen.
