This file is meant to be a short list of things that need to be done, in no
particular order (thus, unnumbered)

Bugs to fix:

- Fix or implement the scroll bar handles on the map display.

Other work:

- Make an image for the 'icons' inventory tab (perhaps an eye?)

- Implement the arrow buttons to scroll map around so that the player does not
  have to be in the middle (eg, after you thing you have completed a level, you
  should be able to scroll around and look at the fog of war spaces and see if
  you've missed anything).

- Add a window for configuration selection

- Perhaps a better splash graphic to show while not connected, since there is a
  lot more space that is not being used.

- Perhaps tie in some display options with scripting?  Eg, and inventory tab in
  which an external script can be used to determine whether to show objects or
  not, perhaps same for information messages?

- Implement drag and drop for the inventory/look windows (would allow moving
  objects from a container directly to the ground for example.

- Change container handling - the client can properly handle multiple
  containers now.  On the client side, not much needs to be changed.  On the
  server side, the server will need to update all active containers when their
  contents change.

- Add support for lower screen resolution (1024x768).  With libglade support,
  this may already be taken care of, or it may also involve things like letting
  a user pick a smaller font in various places..

- Add split window support (probably requires second glade config file) setup)
