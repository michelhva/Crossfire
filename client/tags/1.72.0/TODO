Things to do in no particular order:

Have containers present number of objects/number of different objects in name.

Add a damfactor display to the client (this would be weapon speed * damage of
the weapon)

Allow the seperation character for keybinding to be set to things other than
semicolon - changes for this would really be to fix up the strtok in
extended_command (common/player.c) to pass in the appropriate string, and some
option in the config pane or someplace to change it - note that if it is
changed by the player, then that function would have to go through all the
keybindings updating the current set of complex keybindings for the new
characters.  MSW 2003-02-19

Have inventory/look/container display mechanism which only show icons and
numbers, and not full names - in a sense, a much condensed view of things.

Add a seperate container view (when one is open) in addition to the ground
one, so it is easier to move things here and there (perhaps support drag and
drop operations for this)

Add a 'paper doll' display which shows what is equipped and where.
