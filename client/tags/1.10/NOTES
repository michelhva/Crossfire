These are the official RedHate 6.2 crossfire client RPMS.  The crossfire-client
rpm is the old client. 

The crossfire-client-gtk is the newer GTK client and is GNOME aware and will
install itself under GNOME Foot->Programs->Games, I highly recommend this
client. 

The crossfire-client-sounds is if you want to have sounds during game play.
