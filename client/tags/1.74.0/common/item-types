#
# This file is parsed by the client and gets used for item orderings.
# Order is how items will show in inventory (low numbers first).  There
# is no requirement that the numbers are consecutive.  Max number allowed
# is 254 (255 is reserved for unmatched items.
#
# Note: entries are case sensitive. 
# Note2:  Many entries have a trailing space (ie, 'ring ').  This is
# intentional - this is so they match more closely (otherwise ring
# matches things like stormbringer.
# Note3:  When finding matches for items, the client starts with the
# lowest number and works upward.  So if you want generic matches, it
# is better to put them at a later number so more specific matches will
# happen first.
#
# While this has not been done for all categories, please try to order
# the entries for each category (number) in alphabetical order.

# containers
# Moved containers to the top - this is because of stuff like quiver of
# arrows, but also more convenient

# Weapon types
# Stylistically, I seperate the artifacts here to make it
# a little clear.  It could be said that actually having a different
# element for the artifacts is desirable.
