The original gtk-v2.glade file by Mark Wedel was the basis for the following
layout files.  In fact, all layouts for the GTK-v2 client must contain the
basic widget set found in that work.

- gtk-v2.glade          This layout defaults to use of a 25x25 map.  The
                        default layout size is configured to 1201x1010.  The
                        map itself takes up most of a 1280x1024 screen, and it
                        seems somewhat difficult to use at this resolution and
                        lower.  Stat bars reside in the lower left; stat tables
                        share a tabbed notebook in the lower middle.  Message
                        panes share a tab notebook in the upper right, with
                        inventory and ground views making up the reset of the
                        left hand side of the window.

- dialogs.glade         This file contains all of the ancilliary dialogs used
                        by the GTK V2 client.  Alternative layouts are not
                        provided.

The conversion of the client to support libglade came shortly after Kevin
Bulgrien began developing experimental alternative layouts by copying and
modifying the original gtk-v2.glade layout. Some of those initial layouts
are are found in the following files:

- caelestis.glade       A tri-column layout with a tall inventory/floor panels
                        to the right. At the top middle, a two tab notebook
                        for character and skill/experience data sits above map
                        views beneath. To the top left is a three tab notebook
                        for core stats, critical messages, and protections. At
                        the lower left is the messages pane with entry box.
                        The default window setting supports an 19x22 map pane
                        with an overall size of 1275x945.

- chthonic.glade        A tri-column layout with a tall inventory/floor panels
                        to the right. At the top middle, a two tab notebook
                        holds the map views above character data.  To the top
                        left is the critical message box with the standard
                        message box and command input below.  The bottom left
                        corner two tab notebook houses protections and core
                        statistics.  The default window setting supports an
                        19x22 map pane with an overall size of 1275x945.

                        NOTE:  There seems to be issues with the saving of
                               screen position when resizeable panes are
                               nested.  Though saving works fairly well for
                               this layout, the protections/core statistics
                               area does not restore properly, though the
                               misbehavior is not terribly inconvenient.  The
                               layout needs some work to improve save/restore.

- eureka.glade          A U-shaped layout with inventory and ground views at
                        the top and middle left, a critical and regular
                        message area at the top and middle right, with status
                        bars on the bottom left alongside a three tab notebook
                        for core stats, skills & experience, and protections.
                        The map pane is in the middle of the window and may be
                        set for 17x22 tiles at the default 1180x925 settings.

- gtk-v1.glade          This is a close reproduction of the original GTK V1
                        client with the main exception being the magic map in
                        a tabbed notebook with the map view, and an experience
                        bar that was not present in the legacy client.  At the
                        default settings of 1180x925, the map pane displays a
                        17x17 view of the world around you.  The main drawback
                        of this client layout is probably the quantity of deadi
                        space in the middle column.

- lobotomy.glade        A layout of a slightly different persuasion.  This one
                        sports a map layout on the left.  To the right sit the
                        inventory/ground view and message panes.  Underscoring
                        this unconventional view is a unique cluster of stats
                        and stat bars not seen in other client layouts.  Too
                        round out the uniqueness of this layout, the skill and
                        protections data is laid out below the map in a manner
                        that tends to allow the oversized skills data table to
                        expand naturally while the narrower protections panel
                        shrinks to the data it contains.  Unlike many of the
                        other layouts, tabbed notebooks are avoided except in
                        the map panel.  Window defaults are set at 1280x925,
                        and sport a map pane of 19x22.

- meflin.glade          A player-suggested modification of an experimental
                        layout.  Send in a suggestion, and you might have a
                        layout tuned to your tastes.  Presently a map view
                        notebook is at top right with message, inventory, and
                        ground views sharing a tabbed notebook to the left.
                        At the bottom rest the stat bars and a three tab
                        notebook for character data.  This one is custom-sized
                        at 1233x1001, and at these settings, fits a healthy
                        sized 25x25 map view.

                        Send in a suggestion for a layout, and if you're nice
                        about it, the author will likely be able to whip one up
                        to suit your individual tastes.  For that matter, SVN
                        contains tips on how to roll your own...

- oroboros.glade        A layout designed for 1024x768 desktops.  On the left
                        are a tabbed message window, inventory, and floor view.
                        To the right, at the top is a two tab notebook that
                        contains all of the character statistics, and below it
                        is the map view.  At 1024x768, the map view is 20x13.
                        Since oroboros makes heavy use of tabbed notebooks, it
                        is also appropriate for those that prefer to see less
                        information simultaneously on screen.  Recent removal
                        of the skills panel, made possible by a new skills
                        window, helped reduce the notebook pages and improve
                        visibility of vital data.

- sixforty.glade        This is a layout that defaults to a 640x480 size and
                        was made in response to a request for a small layout.
                        Player name, experience, and level are reported beside
                        the menu bar.  The rest of the layout is cut into four
                        zones with a resize bar allowing the left/right sizes
                        to be adjusted.  In the top-left quadrant lies the map
                        panel, with a tabbed pane for Stats, Protections,
                        and Skills/Experience in the quadrant below it.  The
                        icon view resides in the top right quadrant with the
                        tabbed messages pane and command input occupying the
                        lower right quadrant. At 640x480, a 12x11 map size is
                        workable with inventory views being the big challenge.

                        The most noticable difference in this layout is a more
                        densely packed stats panel that eliminates the Core
                        Statistics panel found in all the previously created
                        layouts.  This panel sports 3-columns with the first
                        containing numeric values for encumbrance, HP, Mana,
                        Grace, Food and XP.  The top of the middle column
                        indicates the readied skill with bar graphs for the
                        stats in the first column below.  The third column
                        lists Speed, WS, WC, Damage, AC, and Armor data.
                        Below these three statistical columns is a row
                        displaying Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Pow, Cha data.

                        It is extraordinarily helpful to set a map and icon
                        scales to 50%.  Other scale factors may also work, but
                        many others also distort the map display unpleasantly.

                        NOTE: sixforty.glade in its present form does not save
                              and restore window positions properly.  It is
                              best to accept the defaults for the present, and
                              as needed, tweak it at run-time.  Plans are to
                              fix this issue eventually.

- un-deux.glade         This layout is still vaguely reminiscent of the
                        original GTK V1 client with the V1-Redux improvements,
                        but it is unique in that the message panes are to the
                        left of the map while the inventory and ground views
                        are on the right. To help keep the most important
                        information at ready eye-level, the encumbrance display
                        and count input box are between the inventory and
                        ground views. The critical and normal message panes are
                        vertically exchanged, with the entry box between,
                        again, to keep the important controls at a consistent
                        eye-level. The fire/run indicators are moved beneath
                        the command input box as they seem all but invisible
                        below the stat bars. The middle of the screen consists
                        of a frame for core stats and a notebook for the map
                        and magic map display, followed by the status bars and
                        protections table.  Notably missing is the skills and
                        experience panel - made possible by the addition of a
                        separate skills window. The window size defaults to
                        1180x925 and comfortably accepts a 19x19 map display.

- v1-redux.glade        A slight improvement on the original GTK client layout
                        with a tab notebook above the map view that conserves
                        space by dispensing with the experience and skills
                        information.  This is made possible by the addition of
                        a detached skills window.  Default window positions
                        fit 1280x1024 or 1400x1050 screens with room to spare
                        for side or bottom panels.  A 17x20 map pane fits well
                        on the default 1180x925 window size.
