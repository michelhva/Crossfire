Project description:
--------------------
JXClient is a client for Crossfire (http://crossfire.real-time.com/).

Requires:
---------
- Sun JVM 1.6.x or higher;
- At least 384MB of memory;

Recommended:
------------
- Sun JVM 1.6.0 or higher;
- Driver-level support for hardware accelerated operations
  (Either OpenGL or DirectX, depending on your system).

Fullscreen support:
-------------------
JXClient uses the fullscreen support provided by the JVM.

Although the client will switch to windowed mode if real fullscreen is not
available, it is important to note that accelerated support will probably end up
being disabled.

You can download an updated version from either http://www.java.com
or from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp .

To check if the graphical operations are accelerated, you can add
"-Dsun.java2d.trace=log,timestamp,count,out:java2d.log" to your JVM command
line, run the client, then check the content of java2d.log.

Compiling the sources:
----------------------
Install Ant on your system; be sure to install the optional tasks as well. Make
sure both the JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME environment variables are set correctly.

Change into the jxclient directory. On the console type "ant" - that's all. Run
the client with "java -jar jxclient.jar".

Connecting through a proxy:
---------------------------
Set an HTTP proxy to allow metaserver access to retrieve the list of available
game servers:

    java -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.hostname and -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080 -jar jxclient.jar

or, alternatively,

    export http_proxy=http://proxy.hostname:8080/
    java -jar jxclient.jar

Set a SOCKS proxy for connection to game servers:

    java -DsocksProxyHost=proxy.hostname -DsocksProxyPort=1080 -jar jxclient.jar
