Requires:
---------
- Sun JVM 1.5.x or higher;
- At least 384MB of memory;

Recommended:
------------
- Sun JVM 1.6.0 or higher (Mustang b60 and onwards);
- Driver-level support for hardware accelerated operations
  (Either OpenGL or DirectX, depending on your system).

Fullscreen support:
-------------------
The JXClient uses the fullscreen support provided by the JVM.
Note that under Linux with a Sun JVM 1.5, fullscreen mode is
not supported.

Although the client will switch to windowed mode if real
fullscreen is not available, it is important to note that
accelerated support will probably end up being disabled.

I strongly encourage you to update Java to version 6 or later. 
You can download an updated version from either http://www.java.com 
or from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp .

To check if the graphical operations are accelerated, you can
add "-Dsun.java2d.trace=log,timestamp,count,out:java2d.log" to
your JVM command line, run the client, then check the content
of java2d.log.

Compiling the sources:
----------------------
Install Ant on your system; be sure to install the optional tasks as well. Make
sure both the JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME environment variables are set correctly.

Change into the jxclient directory. On the console type "ant" - that's all. Run
the client with "java -jar jxclient.jar".
