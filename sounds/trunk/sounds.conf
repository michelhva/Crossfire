# sounds.conf -- client sound definitions
#
# This file contains sound definitions that map actions to certain sounds.
# There are two sections, one for normal sounds and another for spell sounds.
#
# Empty lines are ignored, as are lines beginning with the '#' character.
#
# Format of the file:  pathname to sound, default volume (what volume gets
# played if it is centered on the player), symbolic name (not currently used
# for anything, but may be in the future for the server to communicated to the
# client), and sound number..  Symbolic name and sound number may be omitted.
# If sound number is missing, the sound will be assigned one higher than the
# last sound read in.
#
# the symbolic name can be DEFAULT, in which case all sounds for that section
# which are otherwise not set will be set to that value.  This can be
# especially useful for that magic section, since new spells get added fairly
# often.
#
# The volume of 100 means max volume.  Anything higher may break the sound
# handling.
#
# The server does not currently communicate what sound to play via the sound
# number, so this file is technically obsolete and is likely to discontinued
# once cfsndserv is better equipped to support the sound2 protocol.
