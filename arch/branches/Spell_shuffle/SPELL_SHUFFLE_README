This branch reassigns spells based on the following definitions:

Evocation - Spells that create things (physical damage, food, strengthening)
Sorcery - Spells that remove energy (cold spells, poison, draining?, depletion?)
Pyromancy - Spells that add energy (fire, lightning, light)
Summoning - Spells that call and control monsters (golems, pets, etc)
Praying - Spells gifted by channelling your gods wishes through prayer

For server administrators using this branch for the first time, experience in the sorcery and evocation schools should be flipped. To do so navigate to the player folder (usually /usr/games/crossfire/var/crossfire/players). Any space characters (e.g. \ ) in both folders and file names must be replaced with "_" (e.g. player name.pl -> player_name.pl). admins should then run the following command to swap experience for each player:

grep -rl $"arch skill_evocation" . | xargs sed -i "s/$arch skill_evocation/$arch skill_evoplace/g" && grep -rl $"arch skill_sorcery" . | xargs sed -i "s/$arch skill_sorcery/$arch skill_evocation/g" && grep -rl $"arch skill_evoplace" . | xargs sed -i "s/$arch skill_evoplace/$arch skill_sorcery/g"
