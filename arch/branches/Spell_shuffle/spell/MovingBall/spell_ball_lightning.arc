Master pyromancers, bored of simple fireballs, started toying with the control of balls of lightning. Electricity can be funnelled into a magical framework and then safely thrown at will. Strangely, unlike fireballs that shatter and release flames, this ball lightning hovers unpredictably and even appears to linger around any unfortunate souls in the vicinity before suddenly dissipating. This spell is attuned to the path of electricity.
