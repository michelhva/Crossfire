Few have bargained with dragonkin and benefited, yet knowledge of this spell is a testament to the potential of such a relationship. Unlike traditional pyromancy, Dragonbreath projects fire without the necessity of weaving magic to control it, this results in a cone of fire that is not magical. The potential for pyromancers to inflict burns on magically protected creatures is a massive boon.
