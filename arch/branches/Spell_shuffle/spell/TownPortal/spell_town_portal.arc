Summoners are universally known for their ability to call forth monsters from other realms to do their bidding but few know that this skill can also be used to move the practitioner and their allies to and from the battlefield. By connecting two summons together, a magical portal can be opened instantly teleporting those who use it from one place to another. It must be invoked twice: once to mark the start of the portal, and the second to mark the end. Very few summoners can sustain more than one of these portals at a time.
