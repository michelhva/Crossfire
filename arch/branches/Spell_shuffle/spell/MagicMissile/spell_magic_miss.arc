While evokers can spend a great deal of time mastering the perfect projectile, a different approach is to instead stay focussed on telekinetically guiding the projectile (somewhat accurately) towards an enemy. Magic missile does a comparable amount of damage by guiding the projectile to each target. This spell is attuned to the path of missiles.
