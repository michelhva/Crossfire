Much of pyromancy focuses on the formation of fire and lightning to do harm to others, but, there are other, subtler, applications that can aid wise practitioners. Suspected to have been first taught by the fen faeries, these "fires" are actually light cantrips that are cunningly projected onto nearby souls making their presence widely known.
